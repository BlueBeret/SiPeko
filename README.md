## Contributing
This app is far from finished, a little help is highly appreciated. You can add a feature or update the styling so it looks more like [this](https://www.figma.com/file/dVq5dveDrXM7AT5HKRQMRu/SiPeko?node-id=33624%3A578). The backend also need a refactor and add some api route, but it hasn't uploaded yet in GitHub. I'm quite busy these months, but I'll do it ASAP.  
TODO:  
- [x] make frontend github public  
- [ ] upload backend to github  
- [ ] list what feature need to be done  
- [ ] documentation
